# My Neovim Config

This repo contains my custom neovim config. Feel free to use it. I like it
minimalistic so there's not much in here but what I need.

## Quick Start

**Requirements**

For those who uses Linux or Unix system

```
git clone https://github.com/minmin2104/init.lua.git ~/.config/nvim
```

```
git clone https://github.com/minmin2104/init.lua.git C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\nvim
```
